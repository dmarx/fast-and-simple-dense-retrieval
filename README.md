# FASDR: Fast and Simple Dense Retrieval

FASDR is a library for fast and efficient dense retrieval of text from documents, designed for applications such as document search and information retrieval. It uses SpaCy, Sentence-BERT, and FAISS to perform efficient vector-based similarity search for documents and sentences.

## Basic Functionality and Features

The library provides two main classes: Document and DocumentIndex.

### Document

The `Document` class represents a document and its embeddings. It allows users to search for similar sentences within the document using query embeddings.

Example usage:

```python
doc = Document("path/to/your/file.txt")
query_embedding = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4])
results = doc.search_sentences(query_embedding, k=3)
```

### DocumentIndex

The `DocumentIndex` class represents an index of documents and their embeddings. It allows users to search for similar documents and sentences across multiple documents using a query string.

Example usage:

```python
doc_index = DocumentIndex("path/to/your/documents")
query = "What is the meaning of life?"
doc_results = doc_index.search_documents(query, k=3)
sentence_results = doc_index.search_sentences(query, k=3)
```

## Design Motivations

FASDR aims to provide a simple, efficient, and user-friendly way to perform dense retrieval tasks on collections of documents. The library is built on top of existing powerful libraries such as SpaCy, Sentence-BERT, and FAISS to enable fast and efficient vector-based similarity search for documents and sentences.

## Use Cases

FASDR is well suited for the following use cases:

1. Information retrieval: Quickly search through a collection of documents to find the ones most relevant to a given query.
1. Question-answering systems: Find the most relevant sentences in a document or a collection of documents that can help answer a given question.
1. Document summarization: Extract the most important sentences from a document based on their similarity to a given query or summary embedding.
1. Text clustering and classification: Use the document and sentence embeddings generated by the library to cluster and classify documents based on their semantic content.
